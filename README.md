## Sharing Tracked Changes
If during game play, you want to share all tracked changes made by any player or the game master, first ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.  Next, clone this project using the following command:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/PaulGilchrist/dnd-char-sheet.git
```

Change directory into the newly created project folder, install the needed packages, and start the project

```cmd
cd dnd-char-sheet
npm install
npm start
```

This command will show the network URL the application and API are hosted on.  The API will be started on the same ip but a different port (3000).  Finally, send the following URL to your players, replacing it's IP address with the one reported from the run command.
```url
http://192.168.0.201:5173/dnd-char-sheet?apiUrl=http://192.168.0.201:3000
```

The dnd-char-sheet application will automatically read and write all changes to the API caching them in memory to be quickly shared by all players as well as persisted to disk between game sessions.

## Character JSON File Syntax

The easiest way to make a new character is to download an existing character, modify it following the below syntax, then upload it back into the application.  You can upload multiple character sheets using shift or ctrl keys for bulk selection.

The spelling of anything added such as a language, spell, equipment name, etc. must exactly match the spelling and capitalization as found in the Playerâ€™s Handbook.
