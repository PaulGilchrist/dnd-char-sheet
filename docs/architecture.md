# D&D Campaign Suite — Architecture Document

**Generated:** 2026-08-06

---

## 1. High-Level Overview

**D&D Campaign Suite** (codename "CharSheets") is a full-stack React 19 + Express 5 application for managing Dungeons & Dragons characters, campaigns, and combat. It functions as a digital character sheet, a real-time party-syncing tool, and a full GM toolkit — all served from a single Express process on port 80.

The application supports both D&D 5e and 2024 Essentials rulebooks simultaneously, with each character tagged to their preferred ruleset. No database is used; all persistence is JSON files on disk with an in-memory cache layer.

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, Vite 8, JavaScript (JSX), CSS |
| Backend | Express 5, Node.js |
| Real-time | Server-Sent Events (SSE) |
| Testing | Vitest (jsdom), @testing-library/react, supertest |
| Linting | ESLint 9 (flat config) with custom plugins |
| Icons | Font Awesome Free (CSS) |
| Data | JSON files on disk (`public/data/`, `public/campaigns/`) |
| Build | Vite → `dist/` (static bundle served by Express) |

### Key Capabilities

- **Character management:** 7-step character creation wizard, live-updating digital sheets, import/export JSON
- **Real-time party sync:** Multiple players connect to one server and see the same data via SSE — no accounts or databases
- **Dual ruleset support:** 5e and 2024 Essentials coexist, even mixed within one campaign
- **Combat engine:** Initiative tracker, 200+ automation handlers, event-chain combat pipeline (20+ steps for attacks), multi-target spell targeting, 4-level cover system, metamagic engine, aura systems
- **Map tools:** Indoor grid maps with fog of war and spell overlays, outdoor hex maps with procedural terrain, dungeon generation (BSP algorithm), ruler tool
- **Campaign management:** Quest tracking, faction management (influence scale), NPC management with stat blocks, settlement generation, procedural encounter/loot builders, campaign notes with markdown, activity log

## 3. Module-by-Module Breakdown

### 3.1 Server (`server/`)

The Express server provides two concerns: **API endpoints** and **static file serving**.

**Route Architecture:** All routes are mounted under `/api/` (except `/subscribe` and `/spell-overlay`). Route mount order is critical — specific resource routes (maps, encounters, factions, etc.) are mounted before wildcard `:campaign` routes to prevent path collisions. The `campaigns-changedata` route must be mounted after `campaigns-character` so that `.json` character file routes are not captured by the `:key` wildcard.

**Change Data Store** (`server/utils/changeData.js`): The server maintains four in-memory Maps:
- `characterChangeData` — Per-campaign key-value pairs (HP, spell slots, conditions, etc.)
- `spellOverlayData` — Per-campaign transient spell effect data
- `activeMaps` — Per-campaign active map keys
- `subscribers` — SSE client connections

Changes are debounced (2 seconds) before disk persistence. On process exit, data is saved immediately. `keepAlive()` runs a 60-second health check.

**CRUD Factory** (`server/utils/jsonEntityCrud.js`): `createJsonEntityRouter(entityName, options)` generates standard CRUD routes for any entity stored in `public/campaigns/:campaign/data/:entityName.json`. Supports custom `idField`, `transformList` (filter), `authorizeRead` (access control), and `onDelete` (cleanup). Used by factions, notes, quests, and settlements.

**SSE** (`server/routes/sse.js`): The `/subscribe` endpoint manages SSE connections. Initial snapshot of change data and spell overlays is sent; all subsequent changes are broadcast to every connected client.

### 3.2 Core Rules Engine (`src/services/rules/`)

The rules engine is the **single source of truth** for all character computations. It implements both 5e and 2024 rulesets in parallel.

**`rulesFactory.js`**: Thin dispatch layer that selects race/class rules per ruleset, computes immunities/resistances (including passive automation resistances), and generates `_trackedResources` for runtime state seeding. Master method: `getPlayerStats()` — constructs the full computed stats object.

**`rules.js`** (~1200 lines): The master rules dispatcher. Determines which ruleset applies per character, delegates to ruleset-specific modules, and assembles the `PlayerStats` object. Key exports: `getAbilities()`, `getHitPoints()`, `getAttacks()`, `getSpellAbilities()`, `getArmorClass()`, `getLanguages()`, `getActions()`, `getPlayerStats()`.

**Core Calculations** (`src/services/rules/core/`):
- `abilityCalc.js` / `abilityCalc2024.js` — Ability scores, modifiers, save bonuses, skill bonuses (Expertise)
- `attackCalc.js` / `attackCalc2024.js` — Weapon attacks, spell attacks, monk unarmed strikes
- `spellCalc.js` / `spellCalc2024.js` — Spell abilities, to-hit, save DC, spells known/prepared
- `carryingCapacity.js`, `greatWeaponFighting.js`, `savageAttacker.js`, `starryFormDamage.js`

**Combat Rules** (`src/services/rules/combat/`):
- `applyDamage.js` (~606 lines) — Core damage pipeline: resistance/immunity, save-based reduction, temp HP absorption, death saves, concentration breaks, feature-based damage reduction (Warding Bond, Thought Shield, Heavy Armor Master, etc.)
- `applyHealing.js` — HP recovery with revival from 0 HP
- `coverService.js` — Map-based cover via Bresenham line-of-sight (full, 3/4, 1/2 cover)
- `aoeService.js` — Area of effect hit detection and NPC/Player save handling
- `rangeCheck.js` / `rangeValidation.js` — Grid distance computation, range tier effects (Distant metamagic, melee disadvantage)
- `damageUtils.js` — Damage type extraction, resistance notices, combat context lookups

**Effects System** (`src/services/rules/effects/`):
- `expirations.js` (~1000+ lines) — Master turn-start effects and expiration system. Processes Heroic Inspiration, condition removal, Superior Defense, Elder Champion regeneration, Wild Magic Surge expiration, Inner Radiance, and 30+ effect types.
- `restRules.js` (~1200 lines) — Short/long rest processing: HP restoration, resource resets, exhaustion reduction, class-specific resets (30+ short rest resources, 100+ long rest resources)
- `durationParser.js` — Duration string parsing (`"2_rounds"` → 2, `"1_minute_rounds"` → 0)
- `tranceRules.js` — Elf/Deep Gnome trance detection

**Per-Feature Services** (`src/services/rules/features/`): 56 service files, each implementing automation for a specific spell or class feature. Each exports `trigger<FeatureName>()` functions called from `spellCastService.js` and/or the automation handler registry.

**Spell Casting** (`src/services/rules/spells/`):
- `spellCastService.js` (~1200 lines) — Master spell casting orchestrator. Handles silence blocking, Arcane Ward triggers, Hunter's Mark, save-based damage, attack rolls, AoE modals, post-cast riders, Wild Magic Surge, Empowered Evocation, and 50+ spell-specific handlers.
- `metamagicRules.js` — 8 metamagic effects (Careful, Distant, Empowered, Extended, Heightened, Quickened, Subtle, Twinned)
- `spellPreparationService.js` — Concentration management, spell slot consumption, free cast handling
- `spellValidation.js` — Character creation spell validation
- `spellLimits.js` — Spell limit computation and validation
- `postCastRiderService.js` — Post-cast riders (Beguiling Magic, Soulstitch, Spell Thief)
- `postCastHealService.js` — Post-cast self/ally heals
- `empoweredSpellService.js` — Empowered Spell metamagic dice reroll
- `materialComponents.js` — Consumed material component tracking (38 spells)

### 3.3 Combat Services (`src/services/combat/`)

**Action Pipeline** (`src/services/combat/actionPipeline.js`): An event-chain architecture where each step is `{ name, subscribe, emit, condition, handler }`. Steps subscribe to an event, run their handler, and emit a new event. The pipeline chains steps by matching `emit` → `subscribe`. Observers are decoupled handlers for logging and SSE broadcasting. The pipeline supports pausing via modals and resuming.

**Pipeline Types** (`src/services/combat/steps/index.js`):
- **Weapon attack pipeline** — 20+ steps: housekeeping → battle master maneuvers → cunning strike → bardic inspiration → roll base damage → build context → sneak attack → two-weapon fighting → target effects → superiority die bonuses → automation bonuses → weapon hit bonuses → natural 20 bonuses → celestial revelation → feature riders → damage type modifiers → overchannel → proceed to damage → stalkers' flurry → cleave → tactical mastery → topple → pipeline complete
- **Spell pipeline** — 6 steps: spell housekeeping → spell context → roll damage → feature riders → overchannel → proceed to damage
- **Generic damage pipeline** — 3 steps: housekeeping → roll damage → proceed

**Feature Modules** (`src/services/combat/steps/features/`): 20 feature modules (assassinate, charger, colossus slayer, crusher, eldritch strikes, hunter's mark, piercer, sacred weapon, savage attacker, shield bash, slasher, stalker's flurry, tavern brawler, etc.). Each follows: `condition(ctx)` → boolean, `handler(ctx)` → `{ data, modal?, sideEffects? }`.

**Automation System** (`src/services/combat/automation/`):
- `automationCollector.js` — Core collector. Iterates all features' automation entries, normalizes via `buildAttackInfo()`, categorizes into actions, bonusActions, reactions, specialActions, passives, autoEffects, saveModifiers. 100+ case branches.

- `automationExpressions.js` — Expression resolution engine for damage formulas
- `automationService.js` — Coordination between collector, modifiers, and immunities
- `automationImmunities.js` — Condition and damage immunity collection with runtime checks

**Condition System** (`src/services/combat/conditions/`):

- `targetEffectDefinitions.js` — Registry of ~70 target effects organized into groups (Attack, Defensive, Saves, Spells)
- `conditionSaveService.js` — Save resolution with aura bonuses and passive immunity
- `deathSaveRules.js` / `exhaustionRules.js` — Death saves and exhaustion tracking
- `savePromptService.js` — Save prompt management

**Auras** (`src/services/combat/auras/`): ~15 aura utility files: Aura of Protection, Aura of Courage, Bardic Inspiration state, Corona, Duplicity, Elder Champion, Lion, Wolf, Unbreakable Majesty.

**Summons** (`src/services/combat/summons/summonedCreatureService.js`): Spell-summoned creature lifecycle management.

### 3.4 Automation Handlers (`src/services/automation/`)

Master handler registry with 200+ individual handler functions. `executeHandler(action, playerStats, campaignName, mapName, characters)` dispatches to the correct handler by `action.automation.type`. Handlers are organized by category: buffs, class-*, combat, feats, healing, reactions, resources, spells.

## 6. Key Architectural Decisions

### ADR-1: Dual Ruleset Architecture (5e + 2024)

**Decision:** Both D&D 5e and 2024 Essentials rulesets coexist in one codebase, selected per-character at runtime via `playerSummary.rules`.

**Rationale:** Players may use either ruleset; the application must support both without requiring separate instances.

**Consequences:** Every rules module has two implementations (e.g., `abilityCalc.js` / `abilityCalc2024.js`). The `rulesFactory` and `rules.js` dispatcher routes to the correct implementation. Data files are split (`public/data/` for 5e, `public/data/2024/` for 2024). Shared data (equipment, monsters) lives only in `public/data/`. This doubles the rules engine surface area but allows seamless coexistence.

### ADR-2: Server-First State Management

**Decision:** All game state flows through the runtime store (`useRuntimeState`) and server API. No localStorage for game data.

**Rationale:** Multiplayer synchronization — all players must see the same state. SSE broadcasts ensure real-time consistency.

**Consequences:** `useSyncedState` replaces `useState` for all shared state. SSE re-render loops are prevented via `skipSync=true` and equality guards. ESLint custom rules enforce this (`no-local-game-state` = ERROR, `require-synced-state` = WARN). localStorage is only used for ephemeral preferences (theme).

### ADR-3: In-Memory Persistence with Debounced Disk Write

**Decision:** No database. All data stored as JSON files on disk, with an in-memory cache layer that debounces writes (2 seconds).

**Rationale:** Simple deployment (single `server.js` process), no database infrastructure needed. The in-memory layer provides low-latency reads/writes.

**Consequences:** Risk of data loss on crash (mitigated by `process.on('exit')` save and 2-second debounce). No concurrent write conflicts (single-process server). Character change data is gitignored per-campaign.

### ADR-4: Event-Chain Combat Pipeline

**Decision:** Combat actions use an event-chain pipeline where steps subscribe to events and emit new events.

**Rationale:** Decouples action steps, enables modular feature riders, supports modal pausing/resumption, and makes the attack/damage flow explicit and testable.

**Consequences:** Each attack type (weapon, spell, generic) has its own pipeline configuration. 20+ steps for weapon attacks, 6 for spells. Feature modules (20) are pluggable riders. Observers handle logging and SSE broadcasting independently.

### ADR-5: Automation via Feature Metadata

**Decision:** Class/race features declare automation metadata (type, trigger, damage expressions) that is collected, categorized, and dispatched at runtime.

**Rationale:** Avoids hardcoding every class feature interaction. The automation collector scans all features, normalizes their automation entries, and routes them through a 200+ handler registry.

**Consequences:** New features can be added by declaring automation metadata in the feature definition. The `automationInfoBuilder` dispatches to 21 handler modules based on type (80+ automation types). Expression resolution replaces named variables (class levels, ability modifiers) with actual values.

### ADR-6: Per-Spell Feature Services

**Decision:** Each spell with special automation (sleep, invisibility, silence, etc.) has its own service file in `src/services/rules/features/`.

**Rationale:** Isolates complex spell-specific logic, making it testable and maintainable. The `spellCastService` delegates to the appropriate service.

**Consequences:** 56 feature service files, each following the `trigger<FeatureName>()` pattern. High file count but keeps each file focused and testable.

### ADR-7: Route Mount Order for Path Safety

**Decision:** Express routes are mounted in a specific order — specific resource routes before wildcard `:campaign/:file` routes.

**Rationale:** Prevents path collisions where a `.json` character file endpoint would be captured by the change-data `:key` wildcard.

**Consequences:** Route order is a deployment concern. The `campaigns-changedata` route must always be mounted after `campaigns-character`. Documented in AGENTS.md.

### ADR-8: Procedural Map Generation

**Decision:** Dungeon maps use BSP tree subdivision for room placement with MST corridor connection. Hex maps use axial coordinate math for outdoor travel.

**Rationale:** Provides GM tools for on-the-fly map generation. BSP produces natural-looking dungeon layouts. Hex math enables travel pathfinding.

**Consequences:** Two separate map systems (grid-based dungeon, axial hex). Dungeon generator is the largest service file (~1060 lines). Line-of-sight uses Bresenham's algorithm for both systems.

## 7. Known Constraints and Assumptions

1. **GM features are localhost-only:** Encounter builder, map editing, quest/faction/NPC management are enabled on localhost; network clients get read-only view.

2. **SSE re-render loop prevention:** Always use `skipSync=true` in `setRuntimeObject` when applying SSE-echoed data. The server already has the data; re-POSTing causes loops.

3. **PlayerStats is the single source of truth:** Computed stats from `rulesFactory.getPlayerStats()` must not be bypassed. Don't derive character state from elsewhere.

4. **Route order matters:** Specific routes must be mounted before wildcard routes. Enforced by `server.js` mount order.

5. **Dual ruleset data paths:** 5e data from `/data/`, 2024 data from `/data/2024/`. Shared data (equipment, monsters) is only in `/data/`.

6. **Per-campaign change data is gitignored:** `character-change-data.json`, `campaign-log.json`, and campaign-specific data directories are gitignored.

7. **Combat summary is always present:** There is no "out of combat" state — combat summaries always exist with creature data. Use `getCombatSummary` as the primary source.

8. **Server-first pattern is mandatory:** All game state must go through the runtime store. ESLint rules enforce this.

9. **Single-process server:** No horizontal scaling. The in-memory store and debounced persistence assume a single Node.js process.

10. **5MB JSON body limit:** Image uploads are base64-encoded; Express JSON body parser is configured for 5MB.

11. **2-second debounce for persistence:** Changes are written to disk 2 seconds after the last modification. On process exit, data is saved immediately.

12. **No React Router:** All view switching is done via local `useState` (`activeView`). The `src/routes/config.js` defines all views.

13. **JavaScript, not TypeScript:** All source files are `.js` and `.jsx`. No type annotations.

14. **Font Awesome icons:** Imported globally in `main.jsx`; use `<i className="fa-solid fa-...">` in JSX.

---

## 8. Recommended Future Improvements

1. **Consolidate feature services:** 56 per-spell feature service files could be reduced through a rule-based system (e.g., defining condition effects and save behaviors declaratively rather than with individual service files).

2. **Reduce automation handler count:** 200+ handler functions in `automation/index.js` create a large dispatch table. A more structured registry (e.g., handler classes or modules) would improve maintainability.

3. **Hook consolidation:** 34 combat hooks and 15+ wizard hooks create a large hook surface. Consider grouping related hooks into composite hooks or a hook factory.

4. **Document automation metadata schema:** The feature automation metadata format (type, trigger, damageExpression, etc.) is not formally documented. Adding a schema definition would help developers add new features.
